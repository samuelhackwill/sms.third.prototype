# Quiz - T-020

1. What function was introduced for writing ingestion records to hot RAW logs?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
`appendRawRecord({ source, phoneNumberId, receivedAt, sender, body, meta })` in `imports/server/rawLog.js`.
</details>

2. Which exact hot files are used in T-020?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
`data/raw/hot-osx_messages_app.ndjson` and `data/raw/hot-sim_router.ndjson`.
</details>

3. How is the destination hot file selected for each appended record?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
By the `source` value (`osx_messages_app` or `sim_router`) through a fixed source-to-file mapping.
</details>

4. Which fields are added by the RAW log writer at append time?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
`schema_version` and `ingestedAt`.
</details>

5. What behavior enforces the "exactly two hot files" contract?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The writer throws an error for unsupported `source` values, so only mapped sources can be appended.
</details>

6. What append format is used for persisted raw records?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
NDJSON: one JSON object serialized per line, appended with a trailing newline.
</details>

7. In `appendRawRecord({ source, phoneNumberId, receivedAt, sender, body, meta } = {})`, what does this parameter syntax do?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
It uses object destructuring to pull named fields from a single argument object, and `= {}` provides a safe default so calling `appendRawRecord()` without arguments does not throw before validation.
